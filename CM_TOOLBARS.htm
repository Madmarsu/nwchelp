<h2>Toolbars Command</h2>
<p>
This command is used to enable or disable the listed toolbars. You can use this command to hide or restore toolbars that are available to speed your access to common commands. 
The toolbar names that are checked are those that will be made visible. Those that are not checked will be removed from the screen.</p>

<p>If you have a <a href="MNU_PIANOBAR_ID.htm">piano control</a> included in your toolbar configuration, you can also select the piano style that should be used.
<h4>Piano Style</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">
The piano styles are defined by a <u>piano.ini</u> file, which is generally found in the program files folder, or in the <b>Config Files</b> section of <a href="TAB_OPTIONSFOLDERS.htm">Tools, Options, Folders</a>.
