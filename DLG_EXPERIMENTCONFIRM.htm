<h2>Experimental Features</h2>
<p>
Occasionally, the program will include one or more experimental features that are hidden during normal operation. If a file that uses an experimental feature is opened, 
then the experimental features become available. Before using an experimental file, please read the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any experimental features enabled by an experimental file are not guaranteed to behave in the same manner in future versions of the program. Experimental features are provided for <b>experimental purposes only</b>. 
You may use them, but we strongly recommend that their use be kept to a minimum in order to avoid future conflicts with later versions of the program. 
This is because the experimental features may be changed, or even removed, in the next release of the program.</p>

<p>If you elect to work within an experimental file, <b>you are doing so at your own risk.</b></p>
