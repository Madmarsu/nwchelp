<p>
<b><u>Version 1.75 (features since version 1.70 was released on CD):</u></b></p>
<ul>
<li>New: <i><b>Find</b></i> command on the Edit menu</li>
<li>New: <b><i>Lines</i></b> property in Visual Staff Properties</li>
<li>New: <b><i>Muted</i></b><i> </i>property for Notes</li>
<li>New: <b><i>No Leger Lines</i></b> property for Notes</li>
<li>New: Key signatures with no accidentals now shows the F Natural as a hidden item in the editor</li>
<li>New: Select All command on the Edit menu
<br>
</li>
<li>New: Transpose now preserves note intervals, so relative chord and note positioning are preserved</li>
<li>New: Transpose now includes user control over new key signatures in ambiguous cases</li>
<li>New: A new Audit Enharmonic Spelling command enables you to re-spell the notes in a staff, much like how the Transpose with 0 semi-tones used to work</li>
<li>New: Staff, lyric, and note vertical positioning now support an extended range</li>
<li>New: Bar lines properties can now be changed for an entire selection, making removal of system breaks much easier</li>
<li>New: Standardized lyric syllable alignment is now an option from the Lyric Configuration tab</li>
<li>New: Spacing of notes is now consistent, regardless of whether or not the note is adjacent to an invisible item</li>
<li>New: A staff can now be moved up or down to a new position in the system using Ctrl+Shift+Page Up/Down</li>
<li>New: Beams between a note in the staff and another note extending well above or below the staff now include a slant for improved appearance</li>
<li>New: Hidden accidental display in editor for notes with incoming ties</li>
<li>New: Printing now sends the song filename rather than song title to the print spooler</li>
<li>New: Total song play back time is now displayed in addition to the current elapsed time during play back.</li>
<li>New: When MIDI Port Usage is set to While Playing, a 4 second delay is now taken prior to stopping play back at the end of the song. This allows software synthesizers time to complete play back of the song.</li>
<li>New: Crash protection has been added to the 32-bit edition of the program. The program now attempts to recover from events that used to cause a crash of the program, such as floating point and other math errors. This will often give the user an additional opportunity to salvage unsaved work prior to closing the program.</li>
<li>New: The folder browsing mechanism in Tools | Options | Folders has been enhanced in the 32-bit edition of the program.</li>
<li>New: The editor's scroll bars are now active and available, even while the song is playing.</li>
