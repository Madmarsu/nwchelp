<p><b>Some version 2.0 features explained in more detail:</b>
<p><ul>
<li><b>User selectable notation font</b><br>
The staff notation typeface can now be specified by the user. This is done from <a href="MNU_PAGESETUP.htm">File, Page Setup, Fonts (tab)</a>.
The Staff Size option from version 1 is also found on this tab (moved from the <b>File, Page Setup, Options</b> tab).
<br><br>
</li>
<li><b><a href="MNU_HAIRPINCRESC.htm"><img src="img/cresc.gif"> Crescendo</a> and <a href="MNU_HAIRPINDECRESC.htm"><img src="img/decresc.gif"> Diminuendo</a> Attributes for Selected Notes</b><br>
  Graphic crescendo and diminuendo can now be added as easily as slurs are applied to notes. Simply select the notes
  that are included in the volume swell or fade, then press the <b>&lt;</b> key for a crescendo symbol, or the <b>&gt;</b>
  key for the diminuendo symbol. The hairpins are placed on the staff consistent with the preceding Dynamic mark that you should
  already have inserted into the staff.<br>
  <br>
<b>Note</b> that the shortcut for adding a note accent has been moved to the exclamation point (!).<br>
  <br>
  </li>
<li><i><b><a href="MNU_NOTEHEADX.htm"><img src="img/notehdx.gif"></a> X</b></i><b> noteheads </b>for percussion notes<br>
    You can add new notes that use the X notehead by first selecting the X Notehead 
    tool, then adding notes as normal. The only difference is that the notes will 
    now show up with an X as their notehead. The easiest way to change noteheads 
    during note entry is to use the Q key to cycle through the available notehead 
    styles.<br>
    <br>
    The notehead of existing notes can also be changed by selecting them first, 
    then pressing the X Notehead tool button.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
<li><b><i><b><a href="MNU_NOTEHEADDIAMOND.htm"><img src="img/notehdmd.gif" border="0"></a></b> 
    Diamond </i></b>noteheads for other non-pitched and harmonic notes<br>
    The procedure for inserting diamond notes or changing notes to use the diamond 
    shape is the same as for X noteheads described above, except that the Diamond 
    Notehead tool is selected instead.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
<li><b><i><b><a href="MNU_ADDCLEF.htm"><img src="img/qinsclfd.gif"></a></b></i></b> 
    <b>Percussion Clef</b><br>
    The percussion clef can be added quickly using the new quick insert tool button 
    shown. It can also be adding using the conventional Insert | Clef command. 
    Note that the percussion clef is treated just like a bass clef for MIDI input, 
    play back, and key signature support. Technically, a percussion clef has no 
    concept of pitch, but in the MIDI domain, a means of determining pitch is 
    still necessary. Defaulting to Bass Clef seems to be a good default choice. 
    You can use the Staff Properties Transpose value to alter this behavior as 
    needed. <br>
    <br>
</li>
<li><b>A new Instrument Tree mechanism</b><br>
The NTWPATCH.INI mechanism from version 1 has been removed. A new instrument tree mechanism has been added in its place. User customizable instrument trees are used to create and select predefined instruments, with full control over all instrument properties, including bank select, transpose, and default dynamic note velocities. New Instrument Tree files are added to a dedicated folder that is controlled from Tools|Options|Folders, so you can override the default location of these files. Instrument changes in the staff can now show a custom, user assigned name. Default MIDI note velocities for Dynamics are now under user control via Instrument Properties.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>NWC Clipboard Text<br>
</b>The Find text introduced in version 1 has been extended to support full textual Copy and Paste operations to and from the clipboard. You can now copy and paste large selections of staff notation in the Find text format. This enables you to edit the Find text in a text editor, and then paste it back into the program. The mechanism is automatic. Simply copy notation as normal, but now you can paste the data into any text edit window, such as Windows' Notepad.<br>
<br>
You can see most of the Find text format by simply copying single items from the program into a text editor. When copying single items, more text details are shown than the shorter format used when copying multiple items at once.
<br>
<br>
A <a href="MNU_USERTOOLS.htm">User Tool</a> mechanism is provided which enables prewritten scripts to applied against selected notation.<br>
<br>
You can now also paste simple text into the staff. It is automatically pasted as a text expression.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>User control of note stems</b><br>
    By default, the program tries to make note stem lengths more consistent with conventional notation practices. When necessary, the length of a note stem is now under user control. The stem length can be adjusted, as well as completely hidden.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
<li><b>New Lyricist field</b> (in addition to the existing Author/Composer field)<br>
    File | Info now has a field for Lyricist. This is printed on the left side 
    of the title page at the same vertical position as the Author/Composer field.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
<li><b>Optional support for underscores in your lyrics</b> (shut off translation 
    to spaces)<br>
    The Configuration tab of Edit | Lyrics now has a new option called &quot;Underscore 
    shown as space&quot; which can be unchecked to disable the underscore translation 
    to space feature.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
<li><b>New staff labels</b></li>
<br>
  A staff can now be named and labeled separately. Each staff must have a unique name, but the label is not subject to this restriction. A grand staff label can now be controlled by the first staff in the grand staff brace by simply assigning the other staves to a blank label.<br>
<br>
A new option is added to Tools | Options that controls whether staff  labels will be shown in the editor.
  This new option is separate from the Page Setup options that control whether staff labels appear when
  printing.<br>
<br>
  
<li><b>Hidden items show in active and inactive colors for quicker identification</b><br>
  You can set the exact color scheme that is used in the editor from the Tools | Options | Color area.
  Make sure that you have a score edit window open before going to this area.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>A new anchor symbol</b><br>
A new anchor symbol for expressions that do not preserve width.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Staff notation limits increased to 32000 items</b><br>
    Any staff can now have up to 32000 items in it. Each note, rest, chord, bar line, or other object on the staff counts as
	one item. The old version 1.* limit was 12000 items.<br>
<br>
    </li>
<li><b>More highlight colors</b><br>
   You now have access to seven different highlight colors for drawing special attention to some areas of
   your work. This is more than double the number of highlights that were available in version 1.
  <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Direct entry of Multi-point Controller values</b><br>
   You no longer are required to use the data entry sliders for those small adjustments to your 
   Multi-point Controller settings. New edit boxes for each control point allow you to quickly modify 
   your settings. The sliders are still available for use and reference, and they even update as you change the values in the
   edit boxes.
  <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Windows XP enhancements</b><br>
    If you are using Windows XP, several enhancements will be automatically available in this new version. This new version is more aware of 
	the themes feature that is controlled from the Display applet of the Control Panel. Your selected theme 
    and more of the controls in the program interface will be consistent with your selected theme. Windows XP 
	also allows user control over the hand cursor, and this new version utilizes this system cursor. Lastly, 
	the File Open and Save dialogs include extra options that are only available on Windows 2000, Windows XP, 
	or Windows Vista systems.</li>
