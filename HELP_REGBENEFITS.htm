<h2>Registration Has Its Privileges</h2>
<hr>
<p>
If you are using the unregistered version of <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i>, we have granted you a limited license to try out the software to determine its appropriateness for your needs. We have, however, placed some limits on its use. In most cases, the limits only apply to files that you create on your own, and not the samples that are included with the package, so you can still test out all of the features included in the product. Specifically, the following limitations exist during your evaluation period: </p>
<ol>
<li>You are only granted a license to use the software for 30 days, after which you must either remove the software from your system or purchase a license.</li>
<li>Any files you create are branded as unregistered. Unregistered files can only be saved up to 10 times by unregistered users. After 10 saves, unregistered files can no longer be saved by unregistered users. This restriction no longer applies once you register.</li>
<li>Files created by registered users cannot be changed and then saved by unregistered users.</li>
<li>When you print scores that you or other unregistered users create, the following changes are made prior to printing the piece:
<ol>
<li>An order form is always printed prior to the remainder of the score</li>
<li>A message is included on top of each staff system indicating that this is an unregistered score.</li>
<li>The author and copyright fields that you may have supplied are replaced by <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> specific information.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Copy function in Print Preview is only available on registered scores, such as the included samples.</li>
<li>Notation items cannot be pasted into a registered score file.</li>
<li>The Record command cannot be started with a registered score file.</li>
<li>The Copy Special command cannot be used with an unregistered score file.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once registered, these restrictions are all removed. Any files you created while unregistered can be opened and saved using the registered version, thus branding them as registered files. </p>
<p>
<b>Please note </b>that the above list is the comprehensive set of limitations associated with the evaluation version of the product. We have not included poor printing results, unusual display effects, or any other crippling techniques in the evaluation version as an incentive for you to register. If you are experiencing poor performance with the product, please do not assume that registration will correct these items. In most cases, additional limitations beyond those described above cannot be overcome simply by registering the product. Please keep this in mind during your evaluation. </p>
