<p> This command enables treble, bass, alto, tenor, and percussion clef signs 
  to be added at the insertion point. The visual orientation of notes and chords 
  contained in the score is not changed in any way when adding a clef to the score. 
  Key signatures, however, are changed to represent the current clef. </p>
<p> When adding a clef in front of a series of notes previously placed on the 
  staff, the notes can still be moved to reflect the clef change, if it is necessary. 
  This is accomplished by selecting the region that should be shifted. The notes 
  can then be shifted by pressing &lt;Ctrl+Shift+Up Arrow&gt; or &lt;Ctrl+Shift+Down 
  Arrow&gt; until the notes are placed as desired. The accidental associated with 
  each note is not altered during this process. Note stem and slur directions 
  can be audited if they are incorrect after this operation.</p>
<p>Although in the natural world the percussion clef does not indicate pitch (due 
  to the nature of percussion notated in this clef), for purposes of MIDI input 
  and play back the percussion clef behaves exactly like bass clef. </p>
