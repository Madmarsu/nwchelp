<h2>Marker Command</h2>
<p>This command adds a positioning mark at the insertion point. The mark can be used to control the vertical position, color, and visibility of articulation, slur, and triplet marks that are bound in the note that follows it. There are some special considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Articulation</strong><br><br>These are positioned, colorized, and hidden collectively as a group by a single marker instance. A marker can be used to hide these on a visible note, but cannot be used to force the visibility when they appear on a hidden note.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Slur</strong><br><br>The first note's marker controls the visibility and color of the slur. A slur's color and visibility can be completely controlled by its first note's marker. Other member notes in the slur can utilize a marker to minimize the note's effect on the overall shape of the slur. If a slur extends into a 2nd or higher special ending, then a new marker is required at the start of the special ending.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Triplet</strong><br><br>The color and visibility of a triplet is controlled by the first note's marker. The first note's marker can be used to hide the triplet on a visible note, but cannot be used to force the visibility when a triplet would not normally appear. The starting note's marker is used to control the direction of the triplet bracket, if it has one. The <em><strong>3</strong></em> on a beamed group&nbsp;triplet is positioned based on the first note's marker. A bracket can be forced on a beamed group&nbsp;triplet by adding a marker to the first and last notes in the beam group.</li>
