<p>
This command adds a multi-measure rest at the insertion point. The duration of the rest is controlled by the number of bars of rest that you specify. The length of each bar is
set by the currently active time signature. A multi-measure rest has the unique ability to show whole bar rests when it is hidden, which would commonly be done in a conductor score.
Refer to the <a href="TAB_NTNPROPMMREST.htm">Multi-measure Rest Properties</a> page for a description of its options.
