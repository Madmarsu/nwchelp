<h2>Instrument Change Command</h2>

<p>
This command is used to change the instrument used to perform any staff notation that is mapped to the current staff&#39;s MIDI channel.
Usually, this involves the inclusion of a MIDI Patch change, as well as establishing other performance parameteres that match the
new instrument&#39;s play back characteristics.
<p>
The properties that are included in the Instrument Change box are summarized here:
