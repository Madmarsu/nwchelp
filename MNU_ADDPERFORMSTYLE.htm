<h2>Performance Style Command</h2>

<p>
This command is used to insert a predefined performance expression into the staff. You can select among many pre-existing styles, most of which are the standard Italian spellings for the styles. Currently, only two styles alter the way the score is played back: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Legato</b>: This style causes all note events to be played to their fullest duration, as if all notes that follow the instruction were slurred to the following note.</li>
<li><b>Staccato</b>: This style causes all the notes that follow it to be played with a more staccato feel than normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>
All other styles currently change the style back to the default play back handling. </p>
