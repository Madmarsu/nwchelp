<h2>Rest Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command adds a rest at the insertion point using the duration parameters set in the <a href=SUBMNU_NOTES.htm>Notes</a> menu. New rests can be added most efficiently through use of the space bar on the computer keyboard. </p>
<p>
When adding whole note rests, the duration of the rest may change as new notes, rests, or bar lines are added around it. The program attempts to determine if a whole rest stands alone in a measure so that it can assign a duration equivalent to an entire measure. This requires calculating the time signature associated with this measure. If you experience any difficulties in the visual duration of a particular whole rest, you may need to initiate a refresh of the score. </p>
<p>
The stem direction tools ( <a href=MNU_NOTESTEMUP.htm>Stem Up</a> and <a href=MNU_NOTESTEMDN.htm>Stem Down</a>) apply to rests as well as notes. This is most useful when combining a smaller duration rest with one or more notes to form a split-stem <a href=MNU_ADDCHORD.htm>chord</a>. </p>
