<h2><img src="img/spclend.gif"> Special Ending Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command is used to designate that the current measure should be played during specific iterations of a master repeat loop. Up to seven standard iterations are possible. These are labeled 1st Ending through 7th Ending in the Repeat Loop Ending Specification dialog. The last ending, Default D.S./D.C. Ending, is used after a <i>Da capo</i> or <i>Dal Segno</i> instruction (flow redirection) has been performed. The last primary ending and the default ending are usually followed by a Section Close bar line to designate the end of the master repeat section. </p>
<p>
The special ending containing the first ending <b>must</b> always appear before any other special ending, and <b>must</b> be concluded using a Master Repeat Close bar line. The special ending may be longer than one measure, but only the first measure will contain a printed marker line on top of it. In addition, the first special ending marker <b>must</b> only appear once before the Master Repeat Close is encountered. If more than one first special ending is defined in a single repeat loop, you may get unexpected results. </p>
<p>
Special endings should be added to all staves in a score so that playback is performed properly. The print functionality will automatically suppress the Special Endings that appear on staves other than the top most in a system. </p>
<p>
Several examples of repeated sections are available in the <b>Samples</b> folder in the application directory. They are named REPEAT<i>x</i>.NWC, where <i>x</i> is a single numeric digit. </p>
