<h2><img src=img/tempo.gif> Tempo Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command inserts a tempo designation at the insertion point. The tempo is designated in units of time base beats per minute. You control both the time base (quarter notes, eighth notes, half notes, or their dotted variations) and the beats per minute in that time base. This controls the speed at which a song plays back. The larger the tempo, the faster the song will play. </p>
<p>
It is usually best if tempo changes are designated in only one staff of a score, thus making it easier to keep track of where the tempo changes occur. </p>
<p>
You can also add an additional Italian text expression to a tempo to humanize the tempo instruction for the player. These expressions do not influence the tempo in any way, as the tempo designation is used exclusively for this purpose. You can optionally designate that neither, one, or both of the tempo markers be included in the printout of the staff. The actual tempo change is always indicated in the editor, regardless of whether it has been configured for printouts or not. </p>
