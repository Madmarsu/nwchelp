<h2>Text Command</h2>

<p>
This command is used to insert a text instruction of your choice into the staff. It does not influence play back of the staff in any way, but can be useful when creating a printed score for a real performer. </p>
<p>
As with other expression marks, you can control whether the text preserves its width in the score or does not influence how the score is printed. You can indicate a specific font that should be used
when displaying the text. These are defined in <a href="MNU_PAGESETUP.htm">File, Page Setup</a>.</p>
