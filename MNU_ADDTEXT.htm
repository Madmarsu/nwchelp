<h2>Text Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command is used to insert a text instruction of your choice into the staff. It does not influence play back of the staff in any way, but can be useful when creating a printed score for a real performer. </p>
<p>
As with other expression marks, you can control whether the text preserves its width in the score or does not influence how the score is printed. You can also indicate whether the expression should use the <b><i>italic font,</i></b> the <b>bold font</b>, or a custom font that you specify from <a href=MNU_PAGESETUP.htm>Page Setup</a>. </p>
