<h2><img src="img/sel_timesig.gif"> Time Signature Command</h2>
<p>
A time signature can be added at the insertion point using this command. The time signature is not enforced within the <i>NoteWorthy Composer 2</i> score editor, so bar lines can be placed at your discretion (although the absence of bar lines makes a printout of the score difficult or impossible to achieve). The time signature does influence the duration of whole rest measures that appear in the staff. </p>
<p>
The time signature must be assigned or added manually in each staff for it to appear. </p>
