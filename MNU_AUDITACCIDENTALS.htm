<h2>Audit Accidentals</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command can be used to remove any unnecessary accidentals assigned to notes in the active staff. It compares all notes with the running key signature, and if the accidental it contains matches the running signature, then the accidental is removed. </p>
<p>
Note that this audit does not currently support the automatic placement of hint accidentals that many composers use to remind the player of the implied accidental associated with a note that is in key, but had been altered in the prior measure. </p>
<p>
This audit will not detect if the accidental is the enharmonic version of a note that appears in the key signature. If you want all note spelling to be converted to <i>in key</i> variants, you can use the <b>Audit Enharmonic Spelling</b> command. </p>
