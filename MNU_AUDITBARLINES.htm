<h2>Audit Bar Lines</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command is used to audit the bar line alignment in the active staff. If the audit finds a standard bar line that is not aligned properly, it is removed and a new bar line is added in the proper place. </p>
<p>
This command may change the rhythmic structure of your song! For example, if an existing note starts prior to where a bar line belongs, but extends beyond where the bar line belongs, it is split so that the bar line can be added. </p>
<p>
This command will abort if it finds that a bar line is needed in the middle of a triplet grouping or a split stem chord. If this occurs, you can manually insert a new bar line at the point where the audit aborted, and then re-initiate the audit to complete the job. </p>
