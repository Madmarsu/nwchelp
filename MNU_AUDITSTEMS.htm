<h2>Audit Note Stems</h2>

<p>
This command is used to audit the note and rest stem directions in the current selection (or the active staff when nothing is selected).
It will remove unnecessary stem up or down attributes and recalculate stem directions for note beams and triplets. 
This command is useful after transposing a staff into another key and you want the stem directions to be cleaned up
to reflect the note&#39;s new positions on the staff. </p>
