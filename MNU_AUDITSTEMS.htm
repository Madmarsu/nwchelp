<h2>Audit Note Stems</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command is used to audit all of the note and rest stem directions assigned in the currently active staff. It will remove unnecessary stem up or down attributes and recalculate stem directions for note beams and triplets. This command is useful after transposing a staff into another key and you want the stem directions to be cleaned up to reflect the note's new positions on the staff. </p>
