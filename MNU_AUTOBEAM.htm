<h2>Automatic Beam Command</h2>

<p>
This command can be used to automatically beam a series of adjacent notes that contain stem flags and also fall inside of a beat. This command does not alter any notes that are already beamed, so it can be run several times through the course of creating a score to beam any notes that have not yet been handled. </p>
