<h2>Copy Special Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command makes a graphical copy of the portion of the current selection that fits on the screen, and places it in the clipboard for future paste operations into some other program. You can elect to copy just the selection of the active staff, or the selected portion of all the staves in the current view of the score. If only one staff is shown in the current view of the score, no choice is provided, and the copy of the active staff is completed immediately. </p>
