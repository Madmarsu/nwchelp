<h2><img src="img/courtesy.gif"> Courtesy Accidental</h2>

<p>This command toggles a courtesy accidental indicator, which is applied to an existing or new accidental.
</p>
<p>When applied to a selection, this command generally applies to selected notes that already include an accidental. An exception is made
for single selected notes, which can be given a courtesy accidental by initiating this command, without first adding an accidental.
</p>
<p>A courtesy accidental can also be applied to an individual note via its right click menu.
