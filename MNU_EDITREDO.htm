<p>
The Redo command can be used to re-apply a command that was reversed using the <a href="MNU_EDITUNDO.htm">Undo</a> command. This command is only available immediately after an Undo operation has been performed. If a subsequent change is made to the active staff after an Undo command is performed, the Redo command will no longer be available. </p>
