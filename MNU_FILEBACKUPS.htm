<h2>Open Backup Command</h2>
<p>
This command can be used to open a previous version of a file that has been maintained as a backup file. The program will maintain up to 100 backup copies of a file
while you work on it. Each time you save a file, the prior version is moved into a backup role. The exact number of backups that are maintained for any given file
is controlled by the &quot;Queue size for extra backups&quot; option in the <a href="TAB_OPTIONSFILE.htm">Options, File</a> area. The most recent backup of
a file will be of the form:
<p><b>&lt;FileName&gt;</b>.nwc.<b>bak</b>
<p>Older backups, when present, will be of the form:
<p><b>&lt;FileName&gt;</b>.q#.nwc.<b>bak</b>
<p>The older backups will not necessarily appear in chronological order. If you want to see the list of backups in chronological order, then you should use the Details view of the Open dialog/Windows Explorer and sort by date.
