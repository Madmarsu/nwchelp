<h2>Close File Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command requests closure of the currently active composition. If this composition is currently being played, play is stopped. The window is then closed if it has not been changed since the most recent save or open operation. If the file has been changed, you will be given the opportunity to save the file prior to its closure. </p>
