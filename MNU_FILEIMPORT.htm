<h2>Import Command</h2>

<p>
This command imports an existing music file that is not in NWC song format.</p>
<p>
You can import the following file types:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><u>MID</u> Files
<br>
These files are assumed to be Standard MIDI Files. These are commonly used to exchange music performance data 
between music sequencer, notation, and algorithmic composition software. When imported, the performance data
is converted into standard NWC music notation. </li>
</ul>
