<h2><img src="img/new.gif"> New Command</h2>

<p>
This command is used to create a new <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> composition. A new file is started by selecting a song template and then pressing OK. The template named <b><i>&lt;Blank Score&gt;</i></b> in the <b>General</b> tab is a special template that starts a new file from scratch. </p>
<p>
You can create your own templates by dragging and dropping an existing NWC song file onto the current list of templates. A copy of the file will be made and placed into the same folder as the other templates in the list. The list of templates is generated from the song files contained in the <b>Template</b> folder inside the NWC application folder. Any first level sub-directories in the <b>Template</b> folder are placed into their own tabs in the template list. </p>
<p>
Once a new file has been started, you can edit the new song as any other song being edited in the notation editor. The first time you chose to save the new file, the Save As dialog (see <a href="MNU_FILESAVEAS.htm">Save As Command</a>) will automatically appear so that you can specify the filename for this new song. </p>
<p>
<b><u>More about templates </u></b> </p>
<p>
The templates feature uses standard *.nwc song files as the basis for song templates. A template can be any standard nwc file. The difference between using a template and opening an existing file is that a new file is created without an association to a pre-existing file. When a new file is created based on a template, the template name is only used during the construction of the new file. Later attempts to save the file will need to be named with a new filename. </p>
<p>
<u>Customizing </u> </p>
<p>
All templates are files contained in the <b>Template</b> sub-folder of the NWC application directory. The <b>Template</b> folder can contain one additional level of sub-folders that will be recognized by the template feature. Each sub-folder underneath the <b>Template</b> folder represents a new tab in the <b>File New</b> dialog. You can create your own tabs in the <b>File New</b> dialog by adding folders inside the <b>Template</b> folder. </p>
<p>
New templates can be added to the system in three different ways: </p>
<ol>
<li>A song file can be saved into one of the Template folders in the NWC application directory. This is as easy as a <b>Save As</b> command on the <b>File</b> menu.</li>
<li>A file can be copied into the <b>Template</b> folder using the explorer or file manager programs.</li>
<li>A file can be dragged from the explorer and dropped inside a template list in the <b>File New</b> dialog. This will automatically make a copy of the file and place the copy in the appropriate <b>Template</b> folder.</li>
</ol>
