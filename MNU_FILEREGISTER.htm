<h2>Registration Procedures</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The unregistered version of <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> includes a <b>Register</b> command in the <b>File</b> menu. This command is used after ordering a license from <b><i>NoteWorthy Software</i></b> (see <a href=HELP_ONORDERING.htm>Ordering Information</a>). This command opens the registration dialog where the codes provided to you are used to enable the registered version of <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i>. This command is only useful after having ordered <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i>. </p>
<p>
After ordering <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i>, you will receive a registration package, which includes a diskette with the latest release. Your registration codes will be printed with your name (as provided in your order) and a special code. This information is used to activate your registered license using the Register dialog. You will need to enter both your name and this special code when prompted in the registration procedure. When entering this data, it should be typed exactly as it appears in the registration package, including any punctuation, symbols, and spaces. Your name is case sensitive, so make sure you only capitalize the letters that are capitalized on the registration receipt. Also, be careful about adding extra spaces where none should be. Specifically, there should not be any spaces in the special code provided to you. Be careful not to add any spaces when typing the code into its appropriate field. A check list is included below to further assist you in the event that you are having trouble with your registration codes. </p>
<p>
Once your name and code have been entered correctly, press the OK button and you should now be welcomed as a registered user. If you experience any difficulties with this operation, there is help available. Refer to <a href=HELP_ONSUPPORT.htm>Getting Support</a> for more details. If you ordered from an authorized dealer, you should contact them with questions about your registration code. Before you ask for help, please make sure that you have checked all of the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a space between letters in your registered name? If so, you must include this space when entering it into the Name field.</li>
<li>Are there capital letters in your registered name? If so, these letters must also be capitalized when you enter them into the dialog box.</li>
<li>Is there punctuation, such as a comma or period, in your registered name? If so, these must be included exactly as shown when entering your name into the dialog.</li>
<li>Have you added spacing or punctuation to your name when typing it in that is not reflected on the license receipt? This will cause the registered attempt to fail.</li>
</ol>
