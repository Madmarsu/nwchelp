<h2>Revert File Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command reverts the active score file back to the saved version available on disk. This is a more convenient way of simply re-opening the file that is stored on disk while, at the same time, discarding the current changes made to the active score since the last save operation. Any user messages shown during a standard open of the file are also displayed when reverting back to the saved version with this command. </p>
<p>
After the Revert command has been executed, the changes that were made to the score prior to the most recent save will be lost. For this reason, use this command with care. </p>
