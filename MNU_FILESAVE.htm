<hr>
<p>
This command saves the composition in the active window to its associated file name. If the composition has not yet been given a name, the Save As command will automatically be invoked. </p>
<p>
Just prior to saving the file, <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> optionally checks to see if a file exists with the same name as the one about to be saved. If so, it is optionally renamed to a *.BAK file whenever backup files are enabled. You can always restore the previous version of a file after saving it by copying the *.BAK file to an *.NWC file. This only works for the most recent version of the file that existed prior to the last save operation.</p>
