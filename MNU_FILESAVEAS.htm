<h2>Save As Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command enables saving the currently active composition to a new file.</p>
<p>
The song can also be saved as a MIDI performance by specifying the appropriate file type in the file type box. When saving the song into a MIDI file (*.mid), the file name remains unchanged, as it is necessary to save the file in native *.nwc format in order to preserve all the notation elements in the score.</p>
