<h2><img src="img/cresc.gif"> Crescendo Command</h2>

<p> This command adds a crescendo graphic to selected notes. This is sometimes referred to
  as a hairpin crescendo. The crescendo will appear on the staff in the same vertical position as the most
  recent prior <a href="MNU_ADDDYNAMIC.htm">Dynamic</a> or <a href="MNU_ADDDYNVARIANCE.htm">Dynamic Variance</a>
  (which ever appears first).</p>

<p>This first note after a <a hrefMNU_ADDDYNAMIC.htm>Dynamic</a> change that has this property turned on 
will trigger a gradual volume/velocity dynamic swell or fade. The gradual change is based on the 
<a href="MNU_ADDDYNAMIC.htm">Dynamic instructions</a> that immediate precede and immediately follow the notes
within the hairpin. For longer swell and fade sequences, it is generally preferrable to use the equivalent 
text instruction using the <a href="MNU_ADDDYNVARIANCE.htm">Dynamic Variance</a> item.
You can safely use both items in the same swell or fade, since only the first one that is encountered
will actually be used during play back.
