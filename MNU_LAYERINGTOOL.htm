<h2>Layering Tool</h2>

<p>
This command brings up a list of all parts in the score where layering can be quickly established or removed.
You create a layer in the Layering Tool by selecting all of the parts that should be in the layer, 
then pressing the <b>Make Layer</b> button. If you have only one part selected, then the Make Layer command will 
make that part unlayered, since you are basically making it a layer comprised of a single staff.
</p>
<p>You select multiple parts in the Layering Tool in much the same way as you do from Windows Explorer. 
You can press and hold the shift key to select ranges, or the control key to select individual parts.
