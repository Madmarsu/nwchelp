<hr>
<p>
This command is used to stop or cancel a currently playing score. It can be quickly activated from the keyboard using the <b>F6</b> key. </p>
<p>
If a score is not currently playing, all the open MIDI device ports will be reset. This is a good way to quiet or shut off stuck notes, should this ever happen. </p>
