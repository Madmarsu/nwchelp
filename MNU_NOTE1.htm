<h2><img src="img/note1.gif"> Whole Note Command</h2>

<p>
This command selects a whole note duration for use during note entry. If it is selected when a note, chord member, or rest is added, the resulting item on the staff will have a base duration equivalent to a whole note. </p>
<p>
For audible notes and chord members, this duration is the equivalent of four quarter notes. For rests, the duration can vary depending on whether the rest appears by itself in a measure. If a whole rest stands alone in a measure, the duration is based on the current time signature. </p>
