<h2><img src="img/notehdharmonic.gif"> Harmonic Diamond Notehead Command</h2>

<p>This command selects the harmonic notehead (an open diamond symbol) for use during note entry.
This can be selected prior to inserting the note, or applied 
to existing notes on the staff by selecting them and then applying this command. 
Different noteheads are added in a chord by first selecting the appropriate 
notehead tool, then adding the note to the chord in the customary fashion.</p>
