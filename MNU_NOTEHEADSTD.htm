<h2><img src="img/notehd.gif"> Standard Notehead Command</h2>

<p> This command selects the standard notehead for use during note entry. When 
  applied to a note, the notehead will be the standard variety based on the note&#39;s 
  duration. This can be selected prior to inserting the note, or applied to existing 
  notes on the staff by selecting them and then applying this command. Different 
  noteheads are added in a chord by first selecting the appropriate notehead tool, 
  then adding the note to the chord in the customary fashion.</p>
