<h2><img src="img/notehdx.gif"> X Notehead Command</h2>

<p>This command forces the note to show the X notehead, regardless of its duration.
This can be selected prior to inserting the note, or applied to existing notes 
on the staff by selecting them and then applying this command. Different noteheads 
are added in a chord by first selecting the appropriate notehead tool, then 
adding the note to the chord in the customary fashion.
