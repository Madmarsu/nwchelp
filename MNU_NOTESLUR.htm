<hr>
<p>
This command toggles the outward note slur parameter for use during note entry. When activated, notes entered onto the active staff will automatically be slurred to the right. They will connect with the next note or rest using a slur stroke. </p>
<p>
<b>If you are using the lyric feature</b>: All notes other than the first of a slur will not be associated with a lyric syllable, as they are considered to be a note combination formed to articulate the single syllable. </p>
