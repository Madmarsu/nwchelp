<hr>
<p>
This command converts a group of selected notes, chords, and rests into a triplet grouping. Any existing beam or triplet grouping on these notes is removed before the new triplet grouping is assigned. The grouping must be a valid triplet pair for the operation to succeed. When performing the operation, any pre-assigned note stem directions are ignored, and the best stem direction for the combination of items is chosen. The stem direction for the grouping can be changed afterwards by selecting the whole group and using the stem direction buttons. </p>
<p>
An existing triplet grouping can be removed simply by selecting one member of the triplet group and activating this command. The existing triplet grouping will be removed in this situation. Note that after removal, the stem direction for the notes will still be set, and may require you to manually reset them if you do not like the way they are displayed. </p>
