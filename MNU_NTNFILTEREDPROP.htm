<h2>Filtered Properties Command</h2>
<p>This command is similar to the <a href="/nwc2/help/MNU_OPENPROPERTIES.htm">Edit, Properties</a> command, but allows a filter to be applied that can explicitly qualify or disqualify some objects from being included in the property changes. Refer to the <a href="/nwc2/help/MNU_FIND.htm">Find Command</a> for details.</p>
