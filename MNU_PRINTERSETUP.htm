<p>This command allows you to change your printer device and its configuration. The exact details of the possible options are device and system dependent.</p>
<p>When a new printer is selected from here, it will automatically be remembered and used again when next using the program. However, any printer specific options, such as page size and orientation, are not remembered. These will be reset to the device default when the program is opened.</p>
