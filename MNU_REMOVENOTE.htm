<h2>Remove Chord Note Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command is used to selectively remove members of a chord. The insertion point must be at the same vertical position as the chord member that you want to remove. The insertion point must also be to the right of the chord. </p>
<p>
Note that this command only works on chord members. It does not work on individual notes that are not members of a chord. </p>
