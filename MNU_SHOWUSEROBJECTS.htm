<h2>Manage Objects</h2>
<p>This command brings up a list of all currently installed object types, as well as any new object types found in the current file.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Online Synch</strong> tool to automatically compare all of your object types with their online versions. If an online version exists and it differs from your current version, then you can double click the object type to update it with the online version. This is the recommended way of updating your plugins when newer versions are published by the plugin author.</p>
<p>You can browse the <a class="external" href="https://forum.noteworthycomposer.com/?board=14.0" target="_blank">online library</a> of available plugins from our web site.</p>
