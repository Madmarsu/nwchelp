<h2>Staff Play Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command compiles the active staff and begins to play it back over the selected MIDI devices. This command can be quickly activated using the <b>Shift+F5</b> key combination. This command can be used to review the performance of a single staff without having to go and mute all of the other staves. It will start play back in exactly the same manner as the Play command, except that only the current staff will be played back. This command is <b>not available</b> if the current staff has been muted. </p>
<p>
In some cases, the featured play back of a staff may not stop automatically at the end of the staff. This situation can occur when the featured staff is shorter than other parts in the song, and those other parts have volume, tempo, or controller changes in them which occur after the last note in the featured staff. If this happens, simply press the <a href="MNU_MIDISTOP.htm">Stop</a> button at any time to manually end the play back of the current staff. </p>
