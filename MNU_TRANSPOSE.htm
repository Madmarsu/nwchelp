<h2>Transpose Staff Command</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This command is used to transpose the current staff up or down by a number of semitones. This is most often used to transpose the visual score to another key which matches the natural pitch of the currently selected instrument for the staff. Both notes and any standard key signatures are transposed by the number of semitones that you specify. </p>
<p>
The audible effect of the transpose can be negated so that all staves in the score sound right when played back. This is done using the Transposition field in the global staff parameters. You can designate that the staff play back transposition be updated automatically, or you can change this yourself from inside the <a href=MNU_EDITSTAFF.htm>Staff Properties</a> dialog on the <i>Midi</i> tab. </p>
<p>
You can also use this command to change the enharmonic spelling of notes so that they match the key signature. This is done by specifying an interval of 0 for the transposition. In this case, the notation in the staff will simply be re-spelled, but not shifted up or down on the staff. For example a Gb is in the staff, and the staff is in the key of G. This note could be shown as an F#, and is therefore changed to this kind of note and the accidental is removed. </p>
<p>
In some chord scenarios where an interval of a minor second is used, the result of transposition may include some lost or inaccurate notes in the staff . In cases where this might happen, you are warned, and the chords which may have a problem are shown to you, one by one. The specific things which might cause trouble include: </p>
<ol>
<li>Intervals of a minor second where one or more of the notes in the interval are tied to some other note in the staff which is not a part of the same minor second interval. The note tie may not be correct after transposition, as they may get transposed to different staff positions and accidental assignments.</li>
<li>A group of 3 or more notes that are all separated by an intervals of a minor second. In this case, one or more of the notes may no longer exist after the transposition.</li>
<li>Two overlapping notes combined into a chord.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If any of these situations apply to the staff you are transposing, you should look over the chords as they are shown, and then decide whether you still wish to use the auto-transpose function. </p>
