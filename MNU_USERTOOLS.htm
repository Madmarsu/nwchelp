<h2>User Tool Command</h2>

<p>This command is used to create and access a list of user tools which can be run against the currently active editor window.
You can use the New, Edit, and Remove buttons to create your own user tool commands. A starter set of tools is available 
from <a href="http://www.noteworthysoftware.com/nwc2/">our web site</a>, or on the optional CD.

<p>Developers and advanced users may also wish to explore our <a href="http://my.noteworthysoftware.com/?board=7.0">forum dedicated to User Tools</a>.
