This initiates a close operation on the active window or <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> application. If any data contained within the window has not been saved, you will be given the opportunity to save the data prior to the window being closed. If a notation editor window which is currently playing is closed, the play operation is stopped prior to closure. </p>
