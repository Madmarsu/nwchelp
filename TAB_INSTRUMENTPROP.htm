<h2>Instrument Change Properties</h2>

<p>Instrument properties include:
<p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Patch Name</h4><div class="ctldesc">This is a name for the instrument specified by the other fields. This can be anything, but it is helpful if the 
name describes what sound is expected by the specified properties. This name will also appear in the staff when
an instrument change is inserted into the staff notation.</div>
</li>
<li><h4>Predefined Instruments</h4><div class="ctldesc">You can select from a list of predefined instruments using this button.</div>
</li>
<li><h4>Send Patch</h4><div class="ctldesc">Select the <b>Send Patch</b> box if you want to select a specific MIDI patch number that will be sent to the MIDI synthesizer.
The patch number starts at 0, and goes up to 127 (it is zero based). If you have an external synthesizer that displays
patch numbers, these might start at 1 (it is one based), so you might have to subtract one from the number on the display
when used here.

<p>The easiest way to select a patch number is by using the <b>Predefined instruments</b> button. You can then select 
the instrument by name, rather than number.

<p><b>Note:</b> If the current staff is sharing a MIDI channel with another staff, then only one of the staves
should send patch number information.</div>
</li>
<li><h4>Bank Select</h4><div class="ctldesc">MIDI synthesizers will often support a variety of <b>instrument banks</b>, each containing different 
groups of instrument sounds. Select the <b>Send</b> box to specify a specific bank of sounds. The <b>MSB</b>
field specifies the value for MIDI Controller 0, and the <b>LSB</b> field specifies the value for MIDI Controller 32.

<p>These controller values will then be sent to your synthesizer. Consult your synthesizer manual if you think it supports
multiple patch banks and you want to use this feature.

<p><b>Note:</b> If the current staff is sharing a MIDI channel with another staff, then only one of the staves
should send bank select information.</div>
 options</li>
<li><h4>Default Dynamic Velocities</h4><div class="ctldesc">When dynamics are entered on the staff, they are mapped to MIDI note velocities, unless the dynamic overrides 
these values. The velocity values that are most appropriate for this instrument should be assigned here, so that 
dynamic changes in the staff will sound as you intend.</div>
</li>
<li><h4>Transposition</h4><div class="ctldesc">If this instrument is based on a real world instrument, you can use this setting to make the
notes play back in the same pitch as the real world instrument. For example, if the staff is
notated for a trumpet in Bb, you would enter a value of -2 in this box.</div>
</li>
</ul>
