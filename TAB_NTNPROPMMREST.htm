<h2>Multi-measure Rest Properties</h2>

<p>The multi-measure rest object is used to quickly add multiple bars of rest onto the staff. The number of bars of rest can be set from this tab, and then the following
options control how the bars of rest will appear on the printed page.
</p>

<h3>When Visible on Printed Page</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>Show Only Once</h4><div class="ctldesc">You can use this option to force the multi-measure rest to display the total number of bars of rest in a multiple staff printout, even
if it did not fit entirely within the first system. When this is set, the MMR itself will not appear in later systems, but whole bar rests or empty bars might appear in its place, 
depending on the other options.
</div></li>
</ul>

<h3>When Hidden</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>Print Bar Lines</h4><div class="ctldesc">When the MMR is hidden, this option will cause bar line boundaries to be displayed on the printed page for each empty measure of rest.
</div></li>
<li><h4>Print Whole Rests</h4><div class="ctldesc">When the MMR is hidden, this option will cause a whole rest to be displayed on the printed page for each measure of rest.
</div></li>
</ul>
