<h2>Rest Properties</h2>

<p>
Rest properties can be changed after the rest has been added to the staff. rest properties include:</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Vertical Offset</h4><div class="ctldesc">This option can be used to change the vertical location of a rest on the staff. This is most useful when working with one or more layered staves that overlap each other. The rest can be moved up or down to avoid a collision with a note in another staff.</div>
</li>
<li><h4>Slur Direction</h4><div class="ctldesc">This box controls the direction of a slur on the selected notes, if a slur exists. It is recommended that the slur direction be set the same for all note members belonging in the slur range. This will yield the best results in the editor and when printing.
<p>
This is most useful when working with staff layering, in order to avoid slur collisions with notation in another layered staff.</div>
</li>
<li><h4>Lyric Syllable</h4><div class="ctldesc">Any note, chord, or rest can automatically be used in the placement of lyrics. By default, all notes except rests, grace notes, and notes that receive a tie or slur get attached to a lyric syllable. This box can be used to override the default lyric attachment behavior.</div>
</li>
</ul>
