Once you are happy with how a song looks and sounds, or you just simply want to review the musical material in the song, you can print the score. The printing logic decides how to best format your composition based on all of the options that you specify for the printed page. For example, all of the following page setup options influence how one or more staves are printed onto a page: the selected notation size, the printing device, the page size, the presence of staff names on the front of a system, and the number of staves selected and their size. This provides a great deal of power and flexibility in printing your composition, without you being burdened with all of the formatting decisions while the song is being composed.

<i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> allows you to arrange a song into groups, which allow you to organize your song parts into different viewable sections that can be selected quickly from within 
Page Setup. Note that all staff parts will play back simultaneously, regardless of their group. 
<p>
The staff group is most useful in developing different elements of a song semi-independently. For example, you can create a song with two different groups: one group containing the melody (which might include a vocal staff, and the left and right hands for a piano), and a separate group for drum parts. By placing the drum and other percussive instrument staves in a separate group, and viewing it separately, you can repeat rhythmic patterns more easily without impacting the structure of the melodic score. New groups are automatically created by assigning a unique group name to a staff when it is created or edited using the Staff Properties dialog. 
<p>
You can view parts in the editor either by group or selectively using the 
Page Setup Contents tab.
