</div>

<h4>IDH_DLGSTAFFNAME</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">Enter the name that you would like to be associated with this staff. This name must be unique in the score. It cannot be the same as any other staff name that already is present in the score.
</div>

<h4>IDH_DLGSTAFFLABEL</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">This is a label that identifies the staff. It does not need to be unique.
<p>
If Staff Labels are enabled when printing (from File|Page Setup), this label will be placed to the left of the staff when 
it is printed. When labeling a grand staff, add a label name to the first staff in the brace, then leave the label blank
for the other staves in the grand staff brace.
</div>

<h4>IDH_DLGSTAFFEDT2</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">This box contains the group name that will contain this staff. A score organizes its parts into groups. Each score can have more than one group, with different staff groups assigned via this field. A staff can only reside in a single group.
<p>
A typical use of the staff group would be to divide a song up into melody and rhythm sections. This list box is where each staff can be assigned to a particular group. Each staff can be included in one, and only one, group. Creating a new group is accomplished by simply typing in a new group name in this box. It will then be available to subsequent staff properties. By default, all new staves are assigned into a group called Standard.
</div>

<h4>IDH_DLGSTAFFEDT3</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">The position of the staff can be changed through this list box. The staff will be inserted above the staff selected in this box. If the position is set to default, the position will be not be changed from its current location.
</div>

<h4>IDH_SMARTPROPERTIESINSERT</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">This option controls how placement and visibility properties are set for new items inserted into the staff.
<p>
<b><u>When enabled</u></b>: The <b>Visibility</b> properties for new items are automatically 
configured with default settings.
<p>
The <b>Expression Placement</b> properties are set by finding a similar item elsewhere 
in the staff, and then using it as a basis for positioning the new item. If a similar item
is not found, the program decides on the placement properties based on reasonable defaults.
<p>
If the properties need to be changed, the new item can be selected after it is entered, 
and all properties can be adjusted as necessary.
<p>
<b><u>When disabled</b></u>: All available properties for new items must be set manually.
The properties are initially set to whatever was used the last time this kind of item
was added.

<h4>IDH_DLGTRANSPOSE1</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">This box contains the number of semitones that the staff will be transposed by during execution of the transpose operation. A value of 0 in this box will cause the staff to be enharmonically re-spelled, based on the current key signatures in the staff.
</div>

<h4>IDH_DLGTRANSPOSE2</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">If this box is checked, the staff will be audibly transposed during play back such that the effects of the transpose will not be heard (although they will be seen on screen). This box is most often used to compensate for an instrument that does not match concert C tuning. When transposing to the instruments natural key, a check in this box will ensure that MIDI playback will still sound correctly through your sound card. 
<p>
If you prefer for the effects of the transpose to both be seen and heard, then do not place a check in this box. If you decide to undo the effect later, this can be done from within the Score Builder, using the Edit button for this staff.
</div>

<h4>IDH_DLGLYRICX1</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">The actual lyric text is inserted into this box. When entering lyrics, you should separate each audible syllable with one of the following separators:
<p>
<b>hyphen:</b> The hyphen is used to separate syllables within a word.
<p>
<b>space:</b> A space is used to separate words within a phrase.
<p>
<b>carriage return:</b> A carriage return is used to start a new phrase, but generally the next lyric line is related to the previous line, as if they are part of a single verse or section.

</div>

<h4>IDH_DLGOPTEDITOR5</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">This checkbox is used to control how a click of the right mouse button is treated by the staff notation editor. If you check this box, the editor will re-position the insertion point when you click on the right mouse button. When not check, you must use the left mouse button to first position the insertion point, and then the right mouse button can be used to add notation items. Note that when notation is selected, a right mouse click never re-positions the insertion point, thus leaving the selection present.
</div>

<h4>IDH_DLGOPTEDITOR6</h4>
<div class="ctldesc">This checkbox is used to control how the insertion point is positioned in the score editor. When checked, the insertion point will generally track to the right side of any notes or rests on the staff.
