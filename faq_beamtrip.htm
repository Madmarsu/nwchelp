<h2>FAQ: Forming a note beam or triplet</h2>

<p>
You must select a proper sequence of notes for the commands to become active. For example to beam notes, you must have at least two flagged (ex: eighth) notes selected (highlighted). Once selected, the beam icon will become available as well as the ability to use the quick key <b>Ctrl+B</b>. Clicking the beam icon will beam the selected notes.</p>
