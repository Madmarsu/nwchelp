<h2>FAQ: Collapsible Staff</h2>

<p>
A staff can be collapsed using a Boundary Change instruction. During printing, a staff will collapse when the following conditions are met:

<ol>
<li>the nearest boundary change before the start of the staff line marks the notation section as collapsible</li>
<li>the staff line itself does not contain a boundary change that sets or resets the boundary dimensions</li>
</ol>

<p>When these conditions are met, the staff line will be collapsed in the system, and will not take up space on the printed page.
