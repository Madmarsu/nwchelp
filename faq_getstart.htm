<h2>FAQ: Getting started</h2>

<p>
The best way to get started is to go through the tutorial that comes with the registered version of the program. The tutorial walks you through the process of creating one of the sample songs that come with the program. By stepping through the tutorial, you learn the skills that will help you to create your own songs.
<p>
You can also visit the <a href="HELP_ONSTARTINGUP.htm">Getting Started</a> section. This area will guide you in setting up for play back, creating new songs, and working in the score editor.
