<h2>FAQ: Getting started</h2>

<p>
The best way to get started is to go through the tutorial that is included in the NWC User Guide, which can be found online at <a href="http://www.noteworthysoftware.com">our web site</a>, as well as on the NWC CD. 
The tutorial walks you through the process of creating one of the sample songs included with the program. By stepping through the tutorial, you learn the skills that will help you to create your own songs.
<p>
You can also visit the <a href="HELP_ONSTARTINGUP.htm">Getting Started</a> section. This area will guide you in setting up for play back, creating new songs, and working in the score editor.
