<h2>FAQ: Skipping notes in a lyric</h2>

<p>
If you have a few notes or an entire section of notes that you do not want lyrics assigned to, use an _ (underscore) in the Lyric Editor (Ctrl+L) for each note you want to skip. For example, entering _ _ _ in for Lyrics will skip 3 notes. You can also select the notes that you do not want to have lyrics, press Ctrl+E or Alt+Enter, and under the Notes tab, set Lyric Syllable to Never.</p>
