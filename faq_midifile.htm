<h2>FAQ: Creating a standard MIDI file</h2>
<hr>
<p>
You can create a MIDI file from your song by selecting the <a href=MNU_FILESAVEAS.htm>File | Save As</a> command. Always save your performance as a NWC score file (*.nwc) first, because much of your notation information is lost when saving to a MIDI file.</p>
