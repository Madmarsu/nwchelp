<h2>FAQ: Setting up a MIDI keyboard</h2>
<hr>
<p>
To get MIDI keyboard input to work, here are a few things to try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your keyboard is MIDI capable.</li>
<li>Make sure the cables are connected correctly. Some systems like MIDI In to MIDI In and some like MIDI In to MIDI Out. Even though there is a standard some do it the opposite.</li>
<li>In NWC, Tools:Options, Record tab, make sure you have selected the In Port of your sound card. (You may even want to go through each selection and test).</li>
<li>Make sure you are following the proper procedures for MIDI keyboard input - listed in the next 2 questions and answers.p</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you still cannot record, the problem is most likely the device driver for the input of your soundcard. You should re-install from the setup disk that came with your sound card. If this does not correct the problem, get the latest update driver software from your sound card manufacturer. </p>
