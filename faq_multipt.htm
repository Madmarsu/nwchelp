<h2>FAQ: Why use a multi-point controller</h2>
<hr>
<p>
An example may provide the best explanation. The file <i><b>mpcex.nwc</b></i> demonstrates the use of a multi-point controller for volume changes. When you play back the song, you can hear the volume fade in one area due to a multi-point controller and change instantaneously in another. Select the {mpc} symbol in the file and press Ctrl+E to see how the multi-point controller was set.</p>
