<h2>FAQ: Multi-measure rests</h2>
<p>Insert: Multi-Measure Rest will allow you to set the number Bars of Rest.</p>
<p>When you only have one staff (visible in the editor and for printing), the multi-measure rest symbol with the total number bars of rest will be shown.</p>
<p>When you have more than one staff, in the editor, the rest will stretch as long as the other measures. For printing you will have more options. See the User's Guide for examples.</p>
