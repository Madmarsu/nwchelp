<h2>FAQ: Multi-measure rests</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Multi-measure rests are not currently supported in <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i>. However, the following tips provide a good solution:</p>
<p>
If your primary need is for printing, enter a whole measure rest. Then, with the insertion point to the left of the rest, select Insert: Text. In the Expression box, type |---- &quot;a number for the number of measures to hold the rest&quot; ----|. Set Display Font to Bold. Under Expression Placement, do not check Preserve Width and do set the Staff Position for 6. Click OK. This will place a | ---- x ----| over the whole measure rest, which now looks a lot like a multi-measure rest. If you do not like the vertical placement of the number, select the diamond beside the number, and press Ctrl+E to edit the Staff Position.</p>
<p>
If you also need the multi-measure rest to play back, use Insert: Bar Line (Decorated), to insert a Local Repeat Open and a Local Repeat Close around the rest. When inserting the Local Repeat Close, enter the number of times to repeat the rest (measure).</p>
<p>
You could also use both methods above and create a Print Group and a Play Group.</p>
