<h2>FAQ: Persistent toolbar buttons</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Some of the note attribute buttons in the tool bar will reset after each note is entered. If you would prefer that they remain selected after entering a note, this is possible for some of the buttons. For example, if you will be entering more notes that are accented (Notes | Accent) than are not accented, use Persistent Note Tools command in the Tools menu to keep the Accent icon on.You can also click the Persistent Note Tools icon in the toolbar. </p>
