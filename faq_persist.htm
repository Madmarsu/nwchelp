<h2>FAQ: Persistent toolbar buttons</h2>

<p>
The persistence of the note attribute buttons in the tool bar can be configured using the Persistent Note Tools command. Any note tools that are enabled for persistence will retain their values as you add notes and rests.
The rest of the note attribute buttons will reset to defaults after each entered note. </p>
