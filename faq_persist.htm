<h2>FAQ: Persistent toolbar buttons</h2>

<p>
The persistence of the attribute buttons in the tool bar can be configured using the Persistent Tools command. Any tools that are enabled for persistence will retain their values as you place new items into the staff.
The unselected attributes will reset to defaults after each newly placed item.</p>
