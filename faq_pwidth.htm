<h2>FAQ: Preserve width</h2>
<hr>
<p>
You will often see the option to Preserve Width in dialog boxes where text or symbols are being inserted in the staff. One example is Insert, Text. If you select to Preserve Width, the text will take up its own width on the staff and notes will start after the text. If you do not select Preserve Width, the text will not take any width on the staff. In this case, text placed at the top of the staff will allow notes to be entered under the text. If you do not Preserve Width, the symbol or text you are entering will appear with a diamond beside it. Since the item has no width of its own, the diamond gives you something to select for editing or deleting. The diamond will not appear in your prints.</p>
