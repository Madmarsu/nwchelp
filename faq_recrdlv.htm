<h2>FAQ: Recording a live MIDI performance</h2>

<p>
If you have a MIDI keyboard and the necessary MIDI cables and equipment for your computer, you can capture a live performance and have it notated all within <i>NoteWorthy Composer 2</i>. This is setup as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tools: Options, Record tab</li>
<li>If not set, select the Input Device Driver for your system</li>
<li>Under Import Options, select the placement of the completed notated recording</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
<li>Use File: New to access a rhythm template to use as background play for the record feature</li>
<li>Tools: Record (F4)</li>
<li>Play your MIDI keyboard</li>
<li>F6 to stop recording (or recording will stop at end of background song)</li>
<li>Recording will appear where you set it in Import Options</li>
</ol>
<p>
The performer must synchronize the playing of the keyboard with the tempo that is played by <i>NoteWorthy Composer 2</i>. This is how the program figures out the duration of each note when converting the performance to notation.</p>
