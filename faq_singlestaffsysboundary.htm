<h2>FAQ: Forcing a boundary line in a single staff system</h2>
<p>A single staff system is typically shown as an open-ended staff at the start of each system, with no boundary line/cap at the start of the staff lines. A single staff system line/cap can be forced by adding a Single bar line at the very start of the staff. The presence of the bar line at the very start of the part will trigger a staff boundary for each printed system.</p>
