<h2>FAQ: Adding more space between staves</h2>
<p>Click on the staff you want to add more space around. Press <strong>F2</strong> to bring up the Staff Properties dialog box. Under the <strong>Visual</strong> tab, use the Upper Boundary and Lower Boundary settings. Increasing the Upper setting provides more space above the staff. Increasing the Lower setting gives more space below the staff. Do this for any staves you need more space around.</p>
