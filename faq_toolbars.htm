<h2>FAQ: Moving the toolbars</h2>
<hr>
<p>
<i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> has dockable tool bars. You can move them to one side, to the middle of the screen, or any other place on the screen that is best for you. To move a tool bar, left click and hold inside its border, drag it to where you want to place it and release the mouse button. To vertically align the tool bar, drag it one side of your screen.</p>
