<h2>FAQ: Notation symbols are only partially displayed</h2>

<p>
This is a problem with your printer or display driver. The solution is to get a corrected version of your printer or display driver that does not exhibit this behaviour.</p>
<p>
If your manufacturer does not offer a driver that corrects this bug, you may want to try another option. You can add the OutlineThreshold option to your WIN.INI file under the [TrueType] section, as shown below:</p>
<p>
[TrueType]
<br>
TTEnable=1
<br>
;
<br>
; The OutlineThreshold option can sometimes be used to get the
<br>
; NoteWorthy Composer music font to be fully displayed by a
<br>
; buggy graphics display driver
<br>
OutlineThreshold=32</p>
<p>
This sometimes will work around the display driver bug, but it also causes some display distortion on many types of equipment.</p>
