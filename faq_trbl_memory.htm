<h2>FAQ: Error Insufficient Memory</h2>

<p>
If you really have enough memory (4 Meg recommended), the problem is most likely a corrupted file. There is a good chance that reinstalling from the same *.exe file will fix the problem. It would be best to download the setup program again from our web site and reinstall the program from the new download.</p>
