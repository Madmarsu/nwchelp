<h2>FAQ: Text getting cut-off in printout</h2>
<hr>
<p>
<i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> adds the print margins to the edge of the paper. It does not add the print margins to your printer's unprintable area.</p>
<p>
It is an option of the printer whether to send information to the application noting the printer's unprintable area and the print start point. <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> may not be receiving this info from your printer and that is why Print Preview may show the copyright info on the page and then it does not print. </p>
<p>
This can be corrected by increasing the margin in File | Page Setup. </p>
