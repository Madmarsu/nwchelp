<h2>FAQ: Using new 1.70 features</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The new features added in version 1.70 can be utilized by following the directions included below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color highlighting and printing
<br>
You can set global color options from Tools | Options | Color. You use the colors in two places. For notation, select the items you want to highlight, then select Edit | Properties | Visibility. For staff colors, select Staff | Staff Properties | Visual.
<br>
</li>
<li>User specified system breaks
<br>
This is found in the Bar Line properties. Select the bar line, then press Alt+Enter (or Edit | Properties).
<br>
</li>
<li>Improved handling for back-to-back sections
<br>
Two adjacent bar lines, the first being an ending bar, the second being a corrsponding opening bar, will display better when printing, creating the appearance of a single bar unless broken up by a system break. This behaviour can only be seen correctly while in Print Preview or in a final printout. The editor treats adjacent bar lines differently than the print logic.
<br>
</li>
<li>Improved print preview
<br>
When you select File | Print Preview, a new preview window is now shown. Zoom is accomplished with the mouse. Left clicks zoom in closer, while right clicks zoom out. The area around where you click is automatically shown in the new zoom level.
<br>
</li>
<li>New final bar line styles
<br>
This is found in Staff | Staff Properties | General in the Ending Bar option.
<br>
</li>
<li>User control over slur and tie direction
<br>
This is found in Note properties. Select the notes, then press Alt+Enter (or Edit | Properties).
<br>
</li>
<li>Staff layering for true multi-voice support
<br>
This is enabled via File | Page Setup, then set per staff in Staff Properties (F2).
<br>
</li>
<li>New hide options for more printing flexibility
<br>
Select the notation, then press Alt+Enter (or Edit | Properties).
<br>
</li>
<li>Beam over grace notes, text expressions, and more
<br>
The beams work as before, but now text and other expressions can be inside the beams. You can also beam over grace notes, for things like bag pipe music.
<br>
</li>
<li>Full control over which notes attach to lyric syllables
<br>
After the notes are placed on the staff, select them, then press Alt+Enter (or Edit | Properties), then select the Notes tab. The Lyric Syllable box can be used to force a note to always or never attach to a lyric syllable.
<br>
</li>
<li>Additional controllers/effects supported by Multi-point Controller
<br>
In the editor, press L (or select Insert | Multi-point Controller). The new controllers have been added to the Controller drop-down box.
<br>
</li>
<li>Preserve Width option support for all expressions
<br>
Previously, some expressions did not support the Preserve Width option. Now, they all do, via the new Properties interface.
<br>
</li>
<li>New left, right, and center justification of expressions
<br>
Select the notation, then press Alt+Enter (or Edit | Properties), then Expression Placement.
<br>
</li>
<li>New alignment and placement options for expressions
<br>
Select the notation, then press Alt+Enter (or Edit | Properties), then Expression Placement.
<br>
</li>
<li>User defined text in tempo expressions
<br>
Use the Insert | Tempo command.
<br>
</li>
<li>Longer text expressions
<br>
Use the Insert | Text command.
<br>
</li>
<li>More parts can be shown in the editor at one time
<br>
Selected from File | Page Setup.
<br>
</li>
<li>Improved keyboard navigation in property/tab dialogs
<br>
The new tab dialog interface works as follows. Upon entry, the first control on the selected tab has the focus. You can move the focus onto the tabs, then use the arrow keys to cycle through the tabs (without the tab losing keyboard focus). You can also use Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab top move back and forth between tabs. Ctrl+Page Up/Down can also be used to navigate through the tabs. Lastly, Alt+Home takes you to the first available tab.
<br>
</li>
<li>Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down now works on selected expressions
<br>
If you select just a tempo, or just a text item, or just a rest, you can use Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down arrows to move the item up and down on the staff.
<br>
</li>
<li>Smart Properties Insert
<br>
This new option is available at Tools | Options | Editor. When enabled, the program will automatically determine appropriate &quot;Expression Placement&quot; and &quot;Visibility&quot; properties when an item is first inserted into the staff. This makes it easier to add items on the fly during the initial composing or note entry phase of song entry. When disabled, the &quot;Expression Placement&quot; and &quot;Visibility&quot; properties must be manually set at the time the item is added to the staff.
<br>
</li>
<li>MIDI File Import and Export
<br>
MIDI files are now imported and exported via the Open and Save commands on the File menu.</li>
</ul>
