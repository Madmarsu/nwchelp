<h2>FAQ: Using new 1.75 features</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The significant new features added in version 1.75 can be utilized by following the directions included below:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Importing Lyrics from MIDI Files (1.75a)</b>
<br>
This capability is automatic. Whenever you import a MIDI file that contains lyrics (using the File|Open command), any
lyric text that is included in the file will be imported into a new staff dedicated for lyric text. 
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Saving Lyrics in Exported MIDI Files (1.75a)</b>
<br>
This capability is automatic. Whenever you save your file into a *.mid file, any lyrics in your song will automatically
be included in the MIDI file.
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Find Command </b>
<br>
The Find command is available on the Edit menu. You can use it to find simple text on the staff, or do more complicated find expressions to search for any object on the staff.
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Lines Staff Property </b>
<br>
The Lines property can be found in Staff Properties, on the Visual tab. This option allows you to specify the number of lines that a staff shows in the score. You can even set this to zero, so no staff lines will appear.
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Muted Property for Notes</b>
<br>
The Muted property is found from the Properties command on the Edcit menu when you have one or more notes selected. This allows one or more notes to be muted during play back without having to mute the entire staff.
<br>
</li>
<li><b>No Leger Lines Property for Notes</b>
<br>
The No Leger Lines property is found from the Properties command on the Edit menu when you have one or more notes selected. This allows you to make leger lines disappear for selected notes. This can occasionally be useful in creating visual effects on the staff.
<br>
</li>
<li><b>New Standard Lyric Syllable Placement</b>
<br>
Lyric syllables can now be aligned to their notes in one of two ways. They can either be aligned using standard rules, or using the technique found in earlier versions of the program, at the start of accidentals/notes. The new option can be found in the Lyric Configuration tab, under the heading of Align Syllable Using.</li>
