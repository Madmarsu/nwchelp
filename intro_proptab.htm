<h2>Introduction to Property Dialog Boxes</h2>

<p>
This program makes extensive use of property dialog boxes for setting the various options by the user. A property dialog box includes one or more tabs across the top. Each tab represents a collection of options used to control a particular area or object in the program.</p>
<p>
The various property tabs can be quickly navigated using the mouse or the computer keyboard. When using the mouse, simply click on the tab that contains the properties that you want to view or change. While using the keyboard, various keystrokes can be used to quickly navigate through the tabs. See the <a href="HELP_ONKEYBOARD.htm">Keyboard Guide</a> for more details.</p>
