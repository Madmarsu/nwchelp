<h1>About PCRE</h1>
<p>The PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library is included in NWC for use by the <a href="MNU_FIND.htm">Find</a> and <a href="MNU_NTNFILTEREDPROP.htm">Filtered Properties</a> features. The easiest way to get started with using PCRE is to utilize the many web sites that cover the subject. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pcre.org/" target="_blank">http://www.pcre.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pcre" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/search?q=pcre</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>PCRE License Compliance</h2>
<p>The following section is for PCRE license compliance:</p>
<p>Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package, which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright by the University of Cambridge, England.</p>
<p>The referenced ftp site for the PCRE source is identified in the license as:</p>
<p><a href="ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/">ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/</a></p>
<p>NoteWorthy Software, Inc. has customized the included PCRE mechanism to protect against stack overflow. The modifications are similar to those found in later versions of the official PCRE distribution.</p>
