<h2>Removing <i>NoteWorthy Composer </i></h2>
<hr>
<p>
<i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> includes an uninstall utility in the product. The utility is called <b>UNINSTAL.EXE</b> and it can be used to remove the product from your hard drive. There is an icon created for it in the program manager when the product is installed on Windows 3.1. For Windows 95, a selection is added to the remove software section of the Add/Remove Software applet in the control panel. This makes the removal of the application a relatively simple process. It can be done as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>Close any and all <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i> application windows.
<br>
<br>
Windows will not allow the removal of application files that are currently in use. If you are currently using <i>NoteWorthy Composer</i>, you must exit before continuing these steps. You will also need to close this help file or Windows will prevent you from deleting it.
<br>
</li>
<li>Run the remove utility.
<br>
<br>
This will remove all the application files, as well as any icons originally created in the program manager.
<br>
</li>
<li>If you created any NWC songs, they will not be removed by the utility. You will have to manually remove any files that you created through the File Manager or the Explorer.</li>
</ol>
